# Repository update

(!) Important change!

This update has been released to inform you about a repository update.
Please check the Add-on Store and search for the new "Caddy 2"
Addon, which replaces the current one.

The new add-on is using some automations, making life easier in the long
run :-)

Furthermore, the new Add-on will utilise the GitHub container repository
instead of the Docker Hub.

When switching the add-on, please don't forget to copy the add-on config. Other
actions shouldn't be necessary.
